# responsive-slideshow
A web-based responsive slideshow from scratch that lets someone interactively page through images with buttons and by swiping.

Design decisions were based on delivering the slideshow as a clean layout with enough thumb room to toggle navigation on mobile.

The development process began with gathering all relevant assets and resources. From there, it was a matter of ensuring the functional pieces were in place before ending with fine details.

To improve upon this effort, I would look at reducing the demand on the capturing elements from the DOM and create more robust functions to improved performance.

I'd say much was learned throughout this build. In one instance, the old-school 'for' loop function acheived what the 'forEach' could not. It was apparent that they are purposed quiet differently.
